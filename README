This brain drastically simplifies some aspects of Numenta's CLA's and adds complexity to others.
This has been done in the name of achieving greater similarity to biological brains.
For instance, context is not represented by a set of four neurons in a column,
but rather is passed down through feedback connections with higher level layers.
Also, the idea of crowding out neurons to form sparse representations will be replaced by increasing leaf level
surface area and making leaf level neurons more specialized to certain types of input.

Code follows these style rules: http://code.google.com/p/soc/wiki/PythonStyleGuide

Roadmap:
- Make correct one level brain predictions.
- Form invariant representations.
- Predict different outcome for same input based on context.
- Introduce multiple inputs. i.e. text and visual and audio and location, etc...
- Scale up input to allow phone sized video input.
- Release phone brainy, bitty, bitkid, app.
- Train best brains from community on web data.
