This brain drastically simplifies some aspects of Numenta's CLA's and adds complexity to others.
This has been done in the name of achieving greater similarity to biological brains.
For instance, context is not represented by a set of four neurons in a column,
but rather is passed down through feedback connections with higher level layers.
Also, the idea of crowding out neurons to form sparse representations will be replaced by increasing leaf level
surface area and making leaf level neurons more specialized to certain types of input.

Code follows these style rules: http://code.google.com/p/soc/wiki/PythonStyleGuide

Roadmap:
- Make correct one level brain predictions. Done
- Form invariant representations.
  - Show layers
- Predict different outcome for same input based on context.
- Introduce multiple inputs. i.e. text and visual and audio and location, etc...
- Scale up input to allow phone sized video input.

- Release phone brainy, bitty, bitkid, app.
OR
- Release game where brains can compete.

- Train best brains from community on web data.

Idea:
- Use past 5 time cycles to predict next cycle on same level.
  - 2 cycles ago predicts 2 cycles ahead OR 4 older cycles provide inhibitive effect.

- Feed SURF data in...
- ? Map pixels to different locations based on shade or skip brain and just use SVM
- Rather than mush all temporally close data, compress it.


TODO: Maintain 4 dimensional numpy array. (x, y, z, t) of floats for neuron values
      along with 3 dimensional array (x, y, z) for connections
      to allow more numpy numeric calculations.

      Write ethics post on machine learning.
      - Inevitable
      - No desire for survival
      - No happiness, sadness, anger
      - Will be like cheat-mirroring a chess game until better integration.
      - Current societal and biological problems will be replaced with more difficult space/time problems.
      - Delineation of self from whole will fade completely away.
      - Self will be humanity.

      Finish HTM's vs DBN's.

      Combine Probablistic Max Pooling with temporal pooling.
      - Read paper on how this was done.
      - Do a difference calculation between frames.
        - Gray is just on.
        - White
        - Are prediction feedbacks doing the same thing?


Thoughts from talking w/ Christina
  - Orientation, time of day, and  location may not be that valuable, compared to difficulty in getting that data.
  - Combining time inference at all levels with novelty based controls and deep learning

Questions:
  Why didn't Google use intralayer connections?
